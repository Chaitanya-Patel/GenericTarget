<h1>Thread Overview</h1>
    There are two threads that are always present.
    These are the main thread and the BaseRateScheduler thread.

    The <b>BaseRateScheduler thread</b> has the highest priority (99).
    This thread waits for a timer event, which is set periodically with the base sample rate.
    Then this thread distributes the event to all threads of the model.
    <br>
    <br>
    The <b>main thread</b> executes the main entry function of the application.
    The initialization and termination phases of the generic target application run in this thread.
    In the actual main loop this thread receives messages via the application socket and waits for a termination message
    (<a href="application.html">further information about the main thread</a>).

    The number of additional threads depends on the Simulink model.
    For each sample rate, one additional thread is added.
    The maximum priority is set with the MATLAB class <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> using the parameter <code><a href="simulinkinterface.html">upperThreadPriority</a></code>.
    One additional thread is added for each Write To File block.
    The priority is specified with the parameter <code><a href="simulinkinterface.html">priorityDataRecorder</a></code> via the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> MATLAB class.
    For each UDP port (UDP Receive, UDP Send, Multicast UDP Receive or Multicast UDP Send block) an additional thread is created.
    The priority is set via the block mask of the corresponding block.
    Only one receive block but several send blocks can be used for one UDP port.
    If different priorities are specified for a UDP port, the highest value is used.
