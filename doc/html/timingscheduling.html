<h1>Timing and Scheduling</h1>
    There are several ways to determine the current time.
    The Generic Target Simulink library contains several blocks for determining the time.
    
    <h3>UNIX Time</h3>
    Seconds since 01 January 1970.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>Local Time</h3>
    The local time according to the time zone settings of the target computer.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>UTC Time</h3>
    The UTC time of the target computer.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>Hardware Time</h3>
    The hardware time is the measured execution time that has passed since the model was started.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).
    This timer is steady.

    <h3>Software Time</h3>
    Unlike the hardware time, the software time is not measured.
    The software time is the time that should have passed since the model was started.
    For each time step (with the basic sample rate) a counter is incremented.
    The software time is then calculated once in each time step by multiplying the counter value by the base samplerate.
    Thus this time corresponds to the expected time of the model.

    <h3>Task-Execution Time</h3>
    During code generation, a separate thread is created for each sample time, in which the corresponding step function of the model is executed.
    For each step function the execution time is measured.
    This task execution time is then available in the next time step.
    The task execution time thus indicates the computation time of the last sampling step.
    The initial value for the first step is zero.

    <h3>Task Overload</h3>
    If the task execution time of a thread becomes to large, then the corresponding thread of that task cannot be notified by the base rate scheduler.
    If a task is still running, a <a href="#taskoverload">lost wakeup</a> occurs. The number of task overloads for that task is incremented.

    <h3>CPU Overload and Lost Ticks</h3>
    The high-priority realtime thread of the base rate scheduler waits for the event of a periodic timer that is set with the specified base sampletime of the model.
    Due to operating-system related latency the realtime thread is not able to handle that event immediately but after some short delay. If the timer produced multiple
    events but the realtime thread was not able to handle them in time, a <a href="#cpuoverload">lost tick event</a> occurs. In this case, the number of CPU overloads is incremented and the
    number of lost ticks is incremented by the number of tick events that have been lost.

    <div class="note-orange">
	<h3 class="note-orange">Warning</h3>
    If the host implementation was selected during the <a href="installtoolbox.html">installation</a> of the toolbox, some of these times can also be determined in simulations with the corresponding Simulink blocks.
    However, the behavior is different in the simulation than on the target computer. On the target, the whole time state is calculated once by the base rate scheduler. However, during simulation of a corresponding block
    with host implementation support, the time is calculated immediately when the block is executed.

    <div class="note-red">
	<h3 class="note-red">Limited Support for Windows</h3>
    CPU overload and lost ticks are not supported for windows operating system. Keep that in mind when deploying a model to a host running windows.

<h2>Scheduling</h2>
    The scheduling is done by the BaseRateScheduler, which runs in a <a href="threads.html">thread</a> with the highest priority (99).
    The BaseRateScheduler waits for an event from a timer.
    The event is periodically triggered with the base sample rate.
    The model contains only step functions that are to be executed with a multiple of the base sample rate.
    For each step function a counter is used which is decremented by the BaseRateScheduler.
    If the counter is at zero, the corresponding thread is triggered and the counter is reset to its initial value.
    The triggered thread then executes the corresponding step function of the generated model code.
    The following figure illustrates the scheduling using an example.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><object data="../img/Scheduling.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object></center>
    <br>
    <br>
    Here, the <code>step0()</code> function is executed with the basic sampling rate and the <code>step1()</code> function with twice the sampling time.
    Due to the latency of the operating system there is some delay between the timer event and the high priority thread of the BaseRateScheduler.

    <a name="taskoverload"></a>
    <h3>Lost-Wakeup (Task Overload)</h3>
    If a thread is triggered by the BaseRateScheduler even though the corresponding step function is not yet ready, a lost wakeup occurs.
    The trigger event from the timer is lost.
    A Lost-Wakeup is also called task overload in this context.
    With a task overload, the generic target application is terminated by default.
    However, the parameter <code>terminateAtTaskOverload</code> of the <a href="simulinkinterface.html">Simulink interface class</a> can be used to specify whether the application should be terminated or the task overload should be ignored.
    The number of task overloads (for each thread) are written to the <a href="textlog.html">text log file</a> when the application is terminated.
    If task overloads are ignored, the application continues.
    As stated, the tirgger event from the timer is lost.
    However, the information that one or more events have been triggered is retained.
    Therefore, another <code>step0()</code> function is called directly after the previous <code>step0()</code> function is terminated.
    The number of timer events that lead to a lost wakeup is irrelevant.
    In any case, another <code>step0()</code> calculation is performed directly afterwards.
    This behaviour is illustrated in the following figure.

    <a name="cpuoverload"></a>
    <h3>Lost-Tick (CPU Overload)</h3>
    The BaseRateScheduler waits for the timer event.
    Due to operating-system related latency the realtime thread is not able to handle that event immediately but after some short delay.
    The delay is indicated by the blue arrow. If the computational load of the BaseRateScheduler is too high compared to the base sampletime or the latency is too large, then
    some timer events are lost. Those lost ticks indicate a CPU overload.

    <h3>Scheduling-Policy: FIFO</h3>
    How many threads actually run in parallel in reality depends on the CPU used.
    In principle, the number of threads that can be executed simultaneously in parallel corresponds to the number of CPU cores.
    This does not mean that with a 4-core CPU, the model may have a maximum of four different sampletimes.
    Only the number of threads working in parallel is limited to four.
    The generic target application uses a FIFO strategy for scheduling.
    If there are several tasks to do, they are processed one after the other.
    The following figure shows the already mentioned example for the case that only one thread can work at the same time.
