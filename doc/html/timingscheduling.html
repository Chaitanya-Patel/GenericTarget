<h1>Timing and Scheduling</h1>
    There are several ways to determine the current time.
    The Generic Target Simulink library contains several blocks for determining the time.
    
    <h3>UNIX Time</h3>
    Seconds since 01 January 1970.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>Local Time</h3>
    The local time according to the time zone settings of the target computer.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>UTC Time</h3>
    The UTC time of the target computer.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>Model Time</h3>
    The model time is the measured time that has passed since the model was started.
    This time is determined once for each time step (with the basic sample rate).

    <h3>Simulation Time</h3>
    Unlike the model time, the simulation time is not measured.
    The simulation time is the time that should have passed since the model was started.
    For each time step (with the basic sample rate) a counter is incremented.
    The simulation time is then calculated once in each time step by multiplying the counter value by the base samplerate.
    Thus this time corresponds to the expected time of the model.

    <h3>Task-Execution Time</h3>
    During code generation, a separate thread is created for each sample time, in which the corresponding step function of the model is executed.
    For each step function the execution time is measured.
    This task execution time is then available in the next time step.
    The task execution time thus indicates the computation time of the last sampling step.
    The initial value for the first step is zero.

	<h3 class="note-orange">Warning</h3>
    If the host implementation was selected during the <a href="installtoolbox.html">installation</a> of the toolbox, some of these times can also be determined in simulations with the corresponding Simulink blocks.
    However, the behavior is different in the simulation than on the target computer.

<h2>Scheduling</h2>
    The scheduling is done by the BaseRateScheduler, which runs in a <a href="threads.html">thread</a> with the highest priority (99).
    The BaseRateScheduler waits for an event from a timer.
    The event is periodically triggered with the base sample rate.
    The model contains only step functions that are to be executed with a multiple of the base sample rate.
    For each step function a counter is used which is decremented by the BaseRateScheduler.
    If the counter is at zero, the corresponding thread is triggered and the counter is reset to its initial value.
    The triggered thread then executes the corresponding step function of the generated model code.
    The following figure illustrates the scheduling using an example.

    <br>
    Here the <code>step0()</code> function is executed with the basic sampling rate and the <code>step1()</code> function with twice the sampling time.

    <a name="cpuoverload"></a>
    <h3>Lost-Wakeup (CPU Overload)</h3>
    If a thread is triggered by the BaseRateScheduler even though the corresponding step function is not yet ready, a lost wakeup occurs.
    The trigger event from the timer is lost.
    Only at the next timer event the step function is triggered again.
    A Lost-Wakeup is also called CPU overload in this context.
    With a CPU overload, the generic target application is terminated by default.
    However, the parameter <code>terminateAtCPUOverload</code> of the <a href="simulinkinterface.html">Simulink interface class</a> can be used to specify whether the application should be terminated or the CPU overload should be ignored.
    The number of CPU overloads (for each thread) are written to the <a href="textlog.html">text log file</a> when the application is terminated.

    <h3>Scheduling-Policy: FIFO</h3>
    How many threads actually run in parallel in reality depends on the CPU used.
    In principle, the number of threads that can be executed simultaneously in parallel corresponds to the number of CPU cores.
    This does not mean that with a 4-core CPU, the model may have a maximum of four different sampletimes.
    Only the number of threads working in parallel is limited to four.
    The generic target application uses a FIFO strategy for scheduling.
    If there are several tasks to do, they are processed one after the other.
    The following figure shows the already mentioned example for the case that only one thread can work at the same time.
