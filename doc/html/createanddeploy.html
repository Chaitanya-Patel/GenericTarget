<h1>Create and Deploy a Model</h1>
    Make sure that you have <a href="installtoolbox.html">installed</a> the Generic Target MATLAB toolbox and <a href="preparetarget.html">prepared</a> the target computer.
    To correctly export the source code from a Simulink model, some model settings must be made in Simulink.
    The toolbox comes with a preconfigured Simulink model that should be used as a basis.
    Open MATLAB and run <code>GT.GenericTarget.GetTemplate()</code> to generate a template model in the current working directory.
    The default sample time of the model is 0.01 seconds and can be adjusted.
    <br>
    <br>
    The template model contains a simple test to evaluate the latency.
    Here the <a href="timingscheduling.html">simulation time</a> is subtracted from the <a href="timingscheduling.html">model time</a>.
    The simulation time is a value which is incremented with the sampletime at each sampling step and gives the expected time.
    The model time is a measured time with respect to the model start.
    In this example the difference of both times is recorded and written to a file.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><object data="../img/GenericTargetTemplate.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object></center>
    <br>
    Basically, this test should be performed once for each target to check if the desired sample rate can be used.
    In the ideal case the difference is zero.
    In practice, values in the microsecond range are obtained.
    If the base sampletime becomes too small, it can happen that the realtime kernel in combination with the used target computer is no longer able to maintain the given base sampletime.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Build model and deploy to hardware</h3>
    To generate source code from the Simulink model and deploy it to the hardware, the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> class of the MATLAB package can be used.
    It is helpful to write a MATLAB script for the deployment process.
    A simple script could look like this:
    <pre>username = 'user';                   % Set username of target pc
address  = '192.168.0.100';          % Set address of target pc
model    = 'GenericTargetTemplate';  % Name of the simulink model that is to be deployed

gt = GT.GenericTarget(username, address);
gt.Deploy(model);</pre>
    <div class="note-green">
    <h3 class="note-green">Optional Settings</h3>
    Once a GenericTarget instance is created, additional parameters can be set.
    To do so, simply change the properties of the object before the <code>Deploy</code> method is called.
    For example, if the application should not be terminated in case of a CPU overload, set the corresponding flag to zero with <code>gt.terminateAtCPUOverload = 0;</code>.
    The list with all properties can be found <a href="simulinkinterface.html">here</a>.
    </div>

    <br>
    <h3>Start and stop application</h3>
    After the model has been successfully deployed to the target hardware, the application can be started with <code>gt.Start()</code> and stopped with <code>gt.Stop()</code>.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Download data</h3>
    Make sure that the model is stopped and download the data with <code>data = gt.DownloadData()</code>.
    During the process you will be asked which folder should be downloaded.
    The folder names correspond to the UTC time of the model start.
    The data can also be downloaded manually.
    The class method <code>gt.DecodeTargetLog()</code> can be used to decode the recorded data.
    Information about the file format of data recordings can be found <a href="signalmanager.html#protocol">here</a>.

    <br>
    <div class="note-orange">
    <h3 class="note-orange">Return values</h3>
    All methods that access the target via network call SSH or SCP as system call with appropriate parameters. The methods return the command lines that were called.
    </div>
    <div class="note-red">
    <h3 class="note-red">Important</h3>
    It is important that only one model is deployed at a time.
    The reason for this is that during code generation via MATLAB/Simulink, a zip file is created that always has the same name.
    One should therefore avoid deploying multiple models if the same Simulink code folder is used for code generation.
