<h1>Deployment Process</h1>
    The deployment process consists of two parts.
    First, the code to be built into the generic target framework is generated.
    Then the code is loaded onto the target computer and compiled there.
    The individual steps are shown below.
    The generated zip-archive, which contains the generated code for the target, has the same name as the model.
    Here it is called CodeGeneration.zip.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><object data="../img/BuildAndDeploy.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object></center><br><br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="note-blue">
	<h3 class="note-blue">Note on code generation</h3>
    If only the code is to be generated (blue area, steps 1 to 7), the <code>GenerateCode()</code> method of the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> MATLAB class can be used.
	</div>

    <h3>1. slbuild</h3>
    Generic C/C++ code is generated from the Simulink model.
    The model must be configured to use the pack-and-go functionality of MATLAB/Simulink.
    The generated code is generated together with all necessary Simulink libraries in a compressed zip archive (PackNGo.zip).

    <h3>2. Unzip PackNGo.zip</h3>
    The archive is unpacked into a temporary CodeGeneration folder.

    <h3>3. Remove main() Entry Functions</h3>
    All files containing a <code>main()</code> function are removed.
    The strings <code>"int_T main("</code> and <code>"int main("</code> are searched for.
    The generic target framework has its own main() function.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #f00;">
    The automatic generation of a main entry function cannot be disabled for the grt.tlc target file under Simulink.
    There is the possibility that other MATLAB versions generate different prototypes!
    </span>

    <h3>4. Replace RTW Headers</h3>
    All header files named <code>rtw_windows.h</code> and <code>rtw_linux.h</code> are replaced by header files of the same name, which are located in the <code>packages/+GT/GenericTargetCode/template/</code>
    directory of the toolbox. In these header files the usage of semaphores and mutexes is defined.
    A semaphore or mutex is used to ensure data integrity during parallel read or write accesses to resources by different threads.
    The generated code often includes <code>rtw_windows.h</code>, even if the code is generated for a Linux target.
    For this reason both headers are functionally identical and use <code>std::mutex</code> as mutex.
    <code>std::mutex</code> is standard since C++11 (platform independent).
    POSIX-semaphores are still used as semaphores.
    The source files <code>rtw_windows.c</code> and <code>rtw_linux.c</code> are also deleted.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: #f00;">
    There is a possibility that other MATLAB versions generate different headers or that the source code structure on the MATLAB side changes!
    </span>

    <h3>5. Load codeInfo.mat</h3>
    At this point, the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file created during the slbuild step is loaded.
    This file contains additional information about the generated code such as sample times and thread priorities.

    <h3>6. Generate Interface Code</h3>
    Based on the information in the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file, the Simulink interface class is created.
    Additional parameters set via the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> class are also integrated into the Simulink interface class.
    A template of the Simulink interface class is located in the <code>packages/+GT/GenericTargetCode/template/</code> directory of the toolbox.
    Special entries marked by $ characters are replaced by corresponding values during the code generation of this Simulink interface class.

    <h3>7. Compress to CodeGeneration.zip</h3>
    The temporary CodeGeneration folder now contains the additional source code that must be compiled together with the framework source code to generate the generic target realtime application.
    From this additional source code a zip archive (CodeGeneration.zip) is generated at this point.
    The optional custom code is also included in the zip archive.

    <div class="note-orange">
	<h3 class="note-orange">SSH/SCP</h3>
	MATLAB does not currently have an SSH or SCP client.
    Although it is possible to transfer data to MATLAB via FTP, SSH is required to execute commands anyway.
    For this reason, SSH and SCP commands are called with the <code>system()</code> function of MATLAB.
    An SSH and SCP client must be available on the host computer.
	</div>

    <h3>8. SCP: Upload CodeGenreation.zip</h3>
    The archive CodeGenreation.zip is moved to the home/user directory on the target computer.

    <h3>9. SSH: Unzip</h3>
    The <code>source/SimulinkCodeGeneration/</code> directory and the <code>build/SimulinkCodeGeneration/</code> directory of the generic target framework are deleted first.
    The uploaded archive is then unpacked into the <code>source/SimulinkCodeGeneration/</code> <a href="framework.html">directory on the target</a>.

    <h3>10. SSH: Build Application</h3>
    The make tool is used to compile the software.
    It uses 6 jobs (6 source code files are compiled in parallel).

    <div class="note-green">
    <h3 class="note-green">Starting Application</h3>
    The application is not started automatically at the end of the deploy procedure. To start the application the <code>Start()</code> method of the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> object must be called explicitly.
    The application is started with the appropriate authorization (sudo). The corresponding command looks like this:
    <pre>sudo nohup ~/GenericTarget/bin/GenericTarget &> ~/GenericTarget/bin/log.txt &</pre>
    The nohup command ensures that the output is not routed to the SSH console.
    At the same time, the expression <code>&> ~/GenericTarget/bin/log.txt</code> ensures that the output is redirected to a text file.
    The &amp;-character at the end of the command ensures that the console does not wait for the end of the application.
    This is necessary because otherwise the SSH connection to the target computer remains active until the generic target application is terminated.
