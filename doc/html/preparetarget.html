<h1>Prepare Target Computer</h1>
    First the target computer must be prepared.
    For this purpose the Debian operating system must be installed and configured on the target computer.
    Then the Generic Target Framework is installed. The following steps must be performed.
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#step1">Step 1: Install Debian OS</a></li>
        <li><a href="#step2">Step 2: Configure Debian</a></li>
        <li><a href="#step3">Step 3: Setup Generic Target Framework</a></li>
        <li><a href="#step4">Step 4: Generate SSH Key for Autologin</a></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="step1"></a>
    <h2>Step 1: Install Debian OS</h2>
    Download a network installer for Debian from <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Create a bootable USB stick.
    Then connect the target computer to the Internet and boot from the USB stick.
    During the installation select option "Graphical Install".
    Then just follow the instructions. When partitioning select "Guided - use full disk".
    Then the internal hard disk is selected and the option "All files on one partition" is used.
    During the installation disable the print and enable the SSH server.
    Use GNOME as desktop environment.
    When the installation is complete, remove the USB stick and restart the computer.

    <a name="step2"></a>
    <h2>Step 2: Configure Debian</h2>
    At the beginning you can adjust basic settings.
    The user account should be set so that the user logs in automatically.
    Furthermore, the energy saving setting should be adjusted so that the computer does not automatically switch to standby mode.

        <h3>Install sudo</h3>
        Make sure that sudo is installed on your distribution. Open a terminal and type
        <pre>su</pre>
        to act as root. Then install sudo with
        <pre>apt install sudo</pre>
        Then the user is added to the sudo list
        <pre>adduser <i><u>USER</u></i> sudo</pre>
        For <i><u>USER</u></i> you must specify the username you set during installation.
            <div class="note-orange"><h3 class="note-orange">Note</h3>
                If the adduser command was not found, it is probably because the /usr/sbin directory is not in the system path.
                In this case you can update the path using the command <pre>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin</pre>
            </div>
        In order to execute sudo commands via SSH without password request, edit the sudoers file with
        <pre>nano /etc/sudoers</pre>
        The line starting with "%sudo" must look like this
        <pre>%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</pre>
        Save and close the file.
        Then leave the root mode with
        <pre>exit</pre>
        and restart the computer.

        <h3>Update path</h3>
        Now add the directory <code>/usr/sbin</code> to the path.
        For this purpose the file ~/.bashrc in the home directory is edited.
        Add the following line:
        <pre>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin</pre>

        <h3>Install PREEMPT_RT patch</h3>
        Open a terminal and execute the following command:
        <pre>sudo apt install linux-image-rt-amd64</pre>
        For an architecture other than AMD64 the name may vary.
        Restart the computer.
        To check if the realtime kernel is active, open a terminal and type <code>uname -a</code>.
        You should see something with "SMP PREEMPT RT".

        <h3>Install C++ Compiler + Tools</h3>
        Install the GNU compiler, build tools and C++ libraries with
        <pre>sudo apt install g++ make build-essential</pre>

        <h3>Optional</h3>
        Additional software can now be installed.
        It is recommended to install htop and network tools:
        <pre>sudo apt install htop net-tools</pre>

        <h3>Hardware Tuning</h3>
        Now, some optional settings can be made to the BIOS and operating system to improve the performance and get the lowest possible worst-case latency.
        Here are some pointers to help guide you.
        <ul>
            <li>enable turbo boost if your system supports it</li>
            <li>disable CPU sleep states and CPU frequency scaling</li>
            <li>disable any kind of energy saving options</li>
            <li>disable Hyper-Threading to avoid virtual CPU cores</li>
            <li>disable services you don't need</li>
            <li>if you don't need USB, disable it in the BIOS</li>
        </ul>

    <a name="step3"></a>
    <h2>Step 3: Setup Generic Target Framework</h2>
    Make sure you have <a href="installtoolbox.html">installed the Generic Target MATLAB Toolbox</a>.
    The framework for the generic target is installed using the MATLAB package (<b>GT</b>).
    With the following script the source code for the framework is copied to the target and precompiled.
    Make sure that your Host PC can connect to the target computer.
    SSH and SCP are used to execute commands and copy data, respectively.
<pre>username = 'user';           % Set username of target pc
address  = '192.168.0.100';  % Set address of target pc

gt = GT.GenericTarget(username, address);
gt.Setup();</pre>
    <div class="note-green">
    <h3 class="note-green">Note</h3>
    The default directory on the target computer is <code>~/GenericTarget/</code>, which is created in the home directory.
    If another directory is to be used, it can be passed as a parameter to the <code>Setup()</code> method.
    </div>

    <a name="step4"></a>
    <h2>Step 4: Generate SSH Key for Autologin</h2>
    <div class="note-orange">
    <h3 class="note-orange">Note</h3>
    On Linux this step is optional. However, on Windows this step is <b>required</b> to allow ssh/scp commands to be executed from the
    MATLAB console. The following description applies only to Linux host computers, since some commands are not available on Windows.
    </div>

    While creating, starting and stopping an application on the target computer with the GenericTarget toolbox, commands are executed via SSH.
    The connection from the user PC to the target computer via SSH must be constantly authorized and confirmed with a password.
    Alternatively, keys can be generated and exchanged once.
    Those keys are then used to establish an SSH connection from one computer to another without the need to enter a password.
    SSH keys are stored in the home directory under <code>~/.ssh/</code>.
    This folder can be easily deleted to "forget" all previous SSH connections.
    The following commands are all executed on a user PC, i.e. the client that wants to connect to an SSH server on another computer.

    <div class="note-green">
    <h3 class="note-green">Linux</h3>
        <h3>1. Generate Key</h3>
        With the command
        <pre>ssh-keygen</pre>
        a key is generated. Then you can specify a file name in which the key should be stored.
        With <code>RETURN</code> a default file name is used. Then you can specify a passphrase from which the key will be generated.
        With <code>RETURN</code> an empty passphrase is used. You can use the same key for several target computers.

        <h3>2. Copy Public Key to Target</h3>
        To copy the generated key (public key) to a target computer use the command
        <pre>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub UserName@RemoteServer</pre>
        Here <code>UserName</code> and <code>RemoteServer</code> must be replaced by the user name and IP address of the target computer.

        <h3>3. Add Private Key</h3>
        Now all that remains is to add a private key. To do this, execute the command
        <pre>ssh-add</pre>
        Establishing an SSH connection should now be done without asking for a password.
        For testing, make an SSH connection with the command <code>ssh UserName@RemoteServer</code>.
    </div>

    <div class="note-blue">
    <h3 class="note-blue">Windows</h3>
        <h3>1. Prepare</h3>
        Open PowerShell as an administrator and run
        <pre>Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0</pre>
        to install OpenSSH.

        <h3>2. Generate Key</h3>
        With the command
        <pre>ssh-keygen</pre>
        a key is generated. Then you can specify a file name in which the key should be stored.
        With <code>RETURN</code> a default file name is used. Then you can specify a passphrase from which the key will be generated.
        With <code>RETURN</code> an empty passphrase is used. You can use the same key for several target computers.

        <h3>3. Copy Public Key to Target</h3>
        To copy the generated key (public key) to a target computer use the command
        <pre>scp C:\Users\HostName\.ssh\id_rsa.pub UserName@RemoteServer:</pre>
        where <code>HostName</code> is your host username and <code>UserName</code> and <code>RemoteServer</code> must be replaced by
        the user name and IP address of the target computer. Notice the <code>:</code> character at the end of the command.

        <h3>4. Configure Key</h3>
        Login to the target computer via SSH using
        <pre>ssh UserName@RemoteServer</pre>
        The following commands are all executed on the target computer.
        Next, make sure that the <code>.ssh</code> directory exists on the target. If not, you can create the directory with
        <pre>mkdir .ssh</pre>
        Append the uploaded public key to the authorized keys.
        <pre>cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys</pre>
        and delete the public key.
        <pre>rm id_rsa.pub</pre>
        The <code>.ssh</code> and <code>authorized_keys</code> directories must have the correct set of permissions.
        Execute the following commands
        <pre>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</pre>
        <pre>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre>
        and run
        <pre>exit</pre>
        to logout. or testing, make an SSH connection from the host PC to the target computer with the command <code>ssh UserName@RemoteServer</code>.
