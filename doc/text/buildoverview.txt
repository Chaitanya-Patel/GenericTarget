<h1>Deployment Overview</h1>
    A MATLAB/Simulink model can be created based on the Simulink model template.
    Using the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> MATLAB class, the Simulink model can be brought to the target computer.
    Generic C/C++ code is generated from the Simulink model.
    The generated code essentially contains a class with the methods <code>initialize()</code>, <code>step()</code>, and <code>terminate()</code>.
    The name of the generated class is based on the name of the Simulink model.
    Besides the generated code, the <code>codeInfo.mat</code> file is created during the model code generation.
    This file contains additional information such as sample rates, thread priorities, and function names.
    Based on this information and the settings of the <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> class object, the source code for the <a href="simulinkinterface.html">Simulink interface class</a> class is generated.
    The programming interface from the actual generic target software to this Simulink interface class is always the same.
    The source code for the generic target software comes with the MATLAB package and is copied once to the target computer (see <a href="preparetarget.html#step3">target preparation</a>).
    On the other hand, the source code for the Simulink interface class and the source code for the actual model is generated and copied to the target computer at each <a href="buildanddeploy.html">deploy procedure</a>.
    The software is then compiled on the target computer.

    <h3>Use the MATLAB class GT.GenericTarget</h3>
    For an automatic deployment mechanism, it is useful to write a MATLAB script or function.
    The target computer should already be prepared using the <code>Setup()</code> method (see <a href="preparetarget.html#step3">here</a>).
    First, a <code>GT.GenericTarget</code> instance must be created.

    <pre>gt = GT.GenericTarget('username','hostname');</pre>
    The IP address of the target computer can be specified as host name.
    Afterwards the <a href="simulinkinterface.html">attributes</a> of the class can be adjusted if necessary.
    Using the <code>Deploy()</code> method, a Simulink model can then be transferred to the target computer:
    <pre>gt.Deploy('modelname');</pre>
