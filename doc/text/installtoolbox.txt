<h1>Install the Generic Target Toolbox (MATLAB)</h1>
    The Generic Target Toolbox for Matlab must be installed on the host computer.
    For this purpose, the Toolbox directory can be copied to any location on the host PC.
    During installation, the absolute path to this directory is added to the MATLAB path.
    Afterwards, the toolbox directory must not be moved.
    When using multiple host PCs, it is recommended that each host PC installs the Toolbox locally, since different host PCs generally have different operating systems, MATLAB versions, compilers, etc.
    The directory structure of the <b>Generic Target Toolbox</b> is as follows:
	<ul class="dir">
		<li>doc</li>
		<li>lib</li>
		<li>packages</li>
	</ul>
	<ul class="file">
        <li>install.m</li>
        <li>uninstall.m</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    <table>
		<tr><th>Directory/File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr><td><b>doc</b></td><td>
            Contains this documentation.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>lib</b></td><td>
            Contains the Simulink library "GenericTarget".</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>packages</b></td><td>
            Contains das MATLAB package "GT".</td></tr>

	</table>

    <h2>Install</h2>
    To install the Generic Target Toolbox, MATLAB must be started with administrator privileges.
    Then the installation script <code>install.m</code> must be executed.
    The script simply adds the necessary directory paths to the MATLAB path.
    Furthermore, the build script is executed from the <code>lib/src/</code> subdirectory to generate the necessary mex and tlc files for the driver blocks of the Simulink library.
    The prerequisite is that a C/C++ compiler is set in MATLAB (<a href="http://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html" target="_blank">mex -setup</a>).
    During this process, a prompt appears asking if the host implementation should be used.
    With the host implementation, many blocks of the toolbox can also be used in Simulink simulations.
    More detailed information about the behavior of a block can be found in the corresponding mask description of each block.

    <div class="note-green">
	<h3 class="note-green">Supported blocks for host implementation</h3>
    If the option "Host Implementation" is set during the installation of the toolbox, some blocks will also be usable for simulation in Simulink.
    If the "Host Implementation" option is disabled, most blocks have no effect during a simulation and serve only as code placeholders for the application on the target PC.
    On the target, all blocks have a function.
    The following table shows all blocks that can be used during a simulation in Simulink.

    These blocks have a different function in the simulation than on the target!
    On the target computer all <a href="timingscheduling.html">time information</a> (UTC, UNIX, Local, Simulation, Model) is determined only once during each base sampletime.
    The times are determined in the <a href="threads.html">BaseRateScheduler</a> before all other threads are triggered.
    This has the advantage that all blocks, which provide such time information, always consistently provide the same value within one sample rate.
    However, this is not the case with a simulation in Simulink (with host implementation), because there is no BaseRateScheduler (Simulink does the scheduling).
    Each "time block" independently determines the corresponding time in the simulation.
    This means that, for example, two "Model Time" blocks executed at the same sample rate will produce different results during simulation.

    <h2>Uninstall</h2>
    To uninstall the Generic Target Toolbox, MATLAB must be started with administrator privileges.
    Then the uninstall script <code>uninstall.m</code> must be executed.
    The script only removes the paths set during installation from the MATLAB path.
